Angular Crud with Api
NET Core on the back end and Angular on the front end.
The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of cards.
The back end of the application is implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API
The API exposes a set of endpoints that allow clients to perform CRUD operations on the card data stored in a database. 
The API uses Entity Framework Core to interact with the database and perform operations like create, read, update, and delete.
The Angular application communicates with the back end using HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
The user interface is designed using Angular Material, a UI component library that provides a set of pre-built UI components like buttons, cards, and forms.
The project can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications that require a back end API and a front end client.
